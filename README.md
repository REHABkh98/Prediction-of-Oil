In oil and petroleum exploration and development, artificial intelligence AI gained a remarkable spot as it can be the solution for the issues that arise in this field. Recent studies showed that using data-driven models ensure better prediction results than experience-based prediction model . At the moment, AI is involved in prediction of oil and gas properties, optimization of well layout plans, prediction of reservoir physical properties, and prediction of oil production among others . The figure below illustrates the various interaction models that can be used for predictions including the data driven methods such as regression, classification, and dimensionality reduction.
